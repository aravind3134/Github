To execute the code: 
1. Please go to the Github/code folder and run Nascent_2.py file.
2. Inputs to this file are: paths to training and testing images of mountain and road bikes. Please ensure the correct way of entering the path WITH NO Quotes and WITH '/' symbol at the end. The example input is shown when the code is run.
3. The code takes care of randomly selecting random number of images (10-20), from training data set and moves it to the testing folder.
4. The code is executed 5-fold, to ensure that the code performs well across multiple executions and the average value is taken as final accuracy.

To be included in the repo:
1. The train.py and test.py split is to be done. 
2. VIsualization in tensorflow is to be done and screenshot is to be attached.
3. The report with figures for the selection of optimum hyperparameters is to be comitted.

Will ensure that all the things are done by 4/24/2018.
